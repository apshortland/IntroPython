These lectures provide  some basics in coding with Python. The lectures are provided in Jupyter (.ipnyb) format amd will importted to the student's google colab workspace. The lectures are structured so that there are explanatory text passages followed by code fragments. The example workbooks associated with each lecture gives the student an opportunity to test their knowledge and understanding. Each lecture/example workbook combination will provide some optional material intended to stretch the student.
Lecture 1 introduces variables, basic variable operations, variable conversions, lists of variables, looping and conditional statements, and single level functions.
